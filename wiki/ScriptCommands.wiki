=== PL2 Script Commands ===

Summary of commands used in Polygon Love 2 script files.
This list is based on the script comments and educated guesses.
I give no guarantee that any of them is accurate or correct.

Conventions:
 * Commands are CaSe-SeNsItIvE.
 * Commands that take one or more arguments should be closed with a semicolon, even if the arguments are empty.
 * Calculating time in "frames" assumes a framerate of 60(?)fps.
 * A pound (#) character begins a comment which extends to the end of the line.
 * Labels are introduced with a colon and closed with a semicolon.
